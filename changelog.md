# Level 0 Engine Changelog

## [v0.0.4] - 2026-07-02

### Added
- [ARCHITECTURE] Integrated procedural Hallways and Ajar Doorways into the primary generation heuristic.
- [TEXTURES] Implemented `doorMat`, a procedural corporate woodgrain texture utilizing segmented alpha Bezier curves, recessed panels, and a brass knob.
- [TEXTURES] Created `headerMat` by bifurcating the wall canvas generation state to prevent baseboard texture stretching on structural drop ceilings.

### Changed
- [GEOMETRY] Expanded the procedural manifold grid from 20x20 to 40x40, quadrupling the spatial volume to 1,600 total cells.
- [GEOMETRY] Scaled the physical floor and ceiling bounding planes to 300x300 to safely encapsulate the expanded grid boundary.
- [GEOMETRY] Extended procedural stair generation to 10 steps, explicitly spanning the full 3.0 Y-axis to eliminate entrapment gaps.
- [SYSTEM] Increased `MAX_LIGHTS` to 75 to maintain ambient visibility across the expanded square footage without breaking WebGL shader limits.

### Fixed
- [PHYSICS] Fixed stair ceiling clipping by clamping maximum camera height interpolation to Y=2.8.
- [PHYSICS] Fixed stair step-off entrapment by expanding the Y-axis gravity mapping detector to match the `playerRadius` (0.4), preventing premature vertical drops.
- [GEOMETRY] Fixed Z-fighting and structural clipping between Archways, Hallways, and Doorways by enforcing absolute geodesic parity (all headers locked to Y=2.85, all supporting walls locked to Y=2.7).
- [GEOMETRY] Translated the mathematical origin of door geometries by 0.75 units to create a true edge-hinge, and aligned placement flush with the cell threshold rather than the center void.

## [v0.0.3] - 2026-07-02

### Added
- [UI] Added a dual-hemisphere mobile touch overlay (`#mobile-ui`) for smartphone navigation.
- [UI] Added a dedicated `#menuToggleBtn` to collapse the main control panel and free up the viewport on smaller screens.

### Changed
- [UI] Applied `max-height: 60vh` and `overflow-y: auto` to `.control-panel` to ensure the menu remains accessible and scrollable in landscape orientation.
- [CONTROLS] Swapped the menu toggle listener from a standard `click` to `pointerdown` to bypass the 300ms mobile browser delay.
- [CONTROLS] Applied `touch-action: manipulation` to the menu toggle button to intercept raw touches instantly.
- [CONTROLS] Re-routed desktop pointer lock requests to target `document.body` instead of the canvas, ensuring seamless desktop support beneath the mobile overlay.

### Fixed
- [UI] Lowered the mobile touch zone `z-index` to 5 so it no longer intercepts and consumes clicks meant for the generation and capture buttons.
- [CONTROLS] Injected the mobile translation inputs (`touchMove.deltaX` and `touchMove.deltaY`) directly into the `PlayerController` physics velocity vector.
- [CONTROLS] Enforced a strict `YXZ` camera rotation order on the right touch zone to prevent diagonal thumb dragging from introducing Z-axis roll (gimbal lock).

## [v0.0.2] - 2026-07-01

### Added
- [WEBGL] Added a custom native Post-Processing Pipeline using `WebGLRenderTarget` and a custom GLSL ShaderMaterial.
- [WEBGL] Added a 4-layer VHS effect (Distance-scaled Chromatic Aberration, Animated High-Frequency Static, CRT Scanlines, Claustrophobic Vignette).
- [WEBGL] Created `structMat`, a new procedural Canvas-drawn texture (dark concrete/wood) to provide visual contrast for stairs and archways against the yellow wallpaper.

### Changed
- [WEBGL] Expanded the procedural manifold grid from 100x100 to 250x250, with properly scaled UV texture repeating.
- [WEBGL] Completely overhauled procedural stair generation: Replaced stacked tiers with authentic 5-step directional staircases (N, S, E, W).
- [WEBGL] Drastically reduced staircase spawn rate from 6% to 1.5% to increase liminal rarity.
- [WEBGL] Replaced deterministic sine-wave lighting with stochastic, random-target-seeking intensity logic for authentic broken fluorescent flickering.

### Fixed
- [TESTS] Fixed `test_main.py` execution hook (`.step()` -> `.process_turn()`) for metabolic token integration tests.
- [TESTS] Fixed `test_spatial_parser.py` markdown regex extraction bugs (stripped markdown asterisks preventing capture).
- [TESTS] Added defensive float casting and `try/except` blocks in `brain/cortex.py` to allow metabolic math to safely swallow `MagicMock` objects during isolated unit tests.
- [WEBGL] Eliminated Z-fighting rendering artifacts by adjusting the height and clipping boundaries of procedural archways and stacked stair geometry.
- [WEBGL] Ensured all newly generated stair steps are pushed to the `this.walls` array individually to prevent memory leaks during WebGL Autophagy loop.
