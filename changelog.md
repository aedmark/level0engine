## [v0.0.2] - 2026-07-01

### Added
- [WEBGL] Added a custom native Post-Processing Pipeline using `WebGLRenderTarget` and a custom GLSL ShaderMaterial.
- [WEBGL] Added a 4-layer VHS effect (Distance-scaled Chromatic Aberration, Animated High-Frequency Static, CRT Scanlines, Claustrophobic Vignette).
- [WEBGL] Created `structMat`, a new procedural Canvas-drawn texture (dark concrete/wood) to provide visual contrast for stairs and archways against the yellow wallpaper.

### Changed
- [WEBGL] Expanded the procedural manifold grid from 100x100 to 250x250, with properly scaled UV texture repeating.
- [WEBGL] Completely overhauled procedural stair generation: Replaced stacked tiers with authentic 5-step directional staircases (N, S, E, W).
- [WEBGL] Drastically reduced staircase spawn rate from 6% to 1.5% to increase liminal rarity.
- [WEBGL] Replaced deterministic sine-wave lighting with stochastic, random-target-seeking intensity logic for authentic broken fluorescent flickering.

### Fixed
- [TESTS] Fixed `test_main.py` execution hook (`.step()` -> `.process_turn()`) for metabolic token integration tests.
- [TESTS] Fixed `test_spatial_parser.py` markdown regex extraction bugs (stripped markdown asterisks preventing capture).
- [TESTS] Added defensive float casting and `try/except` blocks in `brain/cortex.py` to allow metabolic math to safely swallow `MagicMock` objects during isolated unit tests.
- [WEBGL] Eliminated Z-fighting rendering artifacts by adjusting the height and clipping boundaries of procedural archways and stacked stair geometry.
- [WEBGL] Ensured all newly generated stair steps are pushed to the `this.walls` array individually to prevent memory leaks during WebGL Autophagy loop.
